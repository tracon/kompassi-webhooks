# Kompassi WebHooks example

We plan to do updating mailing lists, e-mail aliases etc. via webhooks. This is a rough sample
application for those webhooks.

## Requirements

* Python (3.5 preferred, 2.7 works too)
* `virtualenv` or `venv` recommended
* `pip`

## Getting started

    # one-time setup
    python3 -m venv venv3-webhooks
    source venv3-webhooks/bin/activate
    git clone git@github.com:tracon/kompassi-webhooks
    cd kompassi-webhooks
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # run tests
    py.test

    # start app
    python webhooks.py

    # try it (in another terminal)
    curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"token": "secret"}' http://localhost:33001/webhooks/ping

When you return to the project in a new terminal, remember to run `python3 -m venv venv3-webhooks`
first.
